-----------------


‚¶ø `Motivation`: Due to all kinds of reasons like failure of collection sensors, communication error, and unexpected malfunction, missing values are common to see in time series from the real-world environment. This makes partially-observed time series (POTS) a pervasive problem in open-world modeling and prevents advanced data analysis. Although this problem is important, the area of data mining on POTS still lacks a dedicated toolkit. PyPOTS is created to fill in this blank.

‚¶ø `Mission`: PyPOTS is born to become a handy toolbox that is going to make data mining on POTS easy rather than tedious, to help engineers and researchers focus more on the core problems in their hands rather than on how to deal with the missing parts in their data. PyPOTS will keep integrating classical and the latest state-of-the-art data mining algorithms for partially-observed multivariate time series. For sure, besides various algorithms, PyPOTS is going to have unified APIs together with detailed documentation and interactive examples across algorithms as tutorials.

ü§ó **Please** star this repo to help others notice PyPOTS if you think it is a useful toolkit.
**Please** properly `cite PyPOTS <https://docs.pypots.com/en/latest/milestones.html#citing-pypots>`_ in your publications
if it helps with your research. This really means a lot to our open-source research. Thank you!

To make various open-source time-series datasets readily available to our users, PyPOTS gets supported by its sub-project `TSDB (Time-Series Data Base) <https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB>`_, a toolbox making loading time-series datasets super easy!

Visit `TSDB <https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB>`_ right now to know more about this handy tool üõ†! It now supports a total of 168 open-source datasets.

PyPOTS tutorials have been released. Considering the future workload, I separate the tutorials into a single repo,
and you can find them in `BrewPOTS <https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS>`_.
Take a look at it now, and brew your POTS dataset into a cup of coffee!

If you have further questions, please refer to PyPOTS documentation `docs.pypots.com <https://docs.pypots.com>`_.
Besides, you can also `raise an issue <https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/issues>`_ or `ask in our community <#id14>`_.


‚ùñ Available Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PyPOTS supports imputation, classification, clustering, and forecasting tasks on multivariate time series with missing values. The currently available algorithms of four tasks are cataloged in the following table with four partitions. The paper references are all listed at the bottom of this readme file. Please refer to them if you want more details.
