Inclusion Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Similarly to `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms>`_,
PyPOTS mainly considers well-established models/algorithms for inclusion. A rule of thumb is the paper should be
published for at least 1 year, have 20+ citations, and the usefulness to our users can be claimed.

But we encourage the authors of proposed new models to share and add your implementations into PyPOTS
to help boost research accessibility and reproducibility in the field of POTS modeling.
Note this exception only applies if you commit to the maintenance of your model for at least two years.
